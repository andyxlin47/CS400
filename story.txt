Beginning: Once upon a time, in the city of Delzogade, a dog was thrown out into the streets by its owner. It was confused at first and thought the owner was trying to
play with him, but eventually he realized the owner did not want him anymore. He slowly left the house and looked around the street for food. Unfortunately, all he could find
was garbarge scraps. Eventually, he went into an alleyway and found some old food dumped out by restaurants. He was very delighted and rushed over to the food to indulge himself.
However, he was not alone and could slowly hear more and more growls. As he looked up, he realized he was surrounded at all angles and had no escape.
