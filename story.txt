Beginning: Once upon a time, in the city of Delzogade, a dog was thrown out into the streets by its owner. It was confused at first and thought the owner was trying to
play with him, but eventually he realized the owner did not want him anymore. He slowly left the house and looked around the street for food. Unfortunately, all he could find
was garbarge scraps. Eventually, he went into an alleyway and found some old food dumped out by restaurants. He was very delighted and rushed over to the food to indulge himself.
However, he was not alone and could slowly hear more and more growls. As he looked up, he realized he was surrounded at all angles and had no escape.

Middle: Suddenly, 10 dogs appeared from the shadows, blocking any exit from the alleyway. All of them were eyeing up the food that he ws about to eat and growling with hunger. The dogs slowly inched towards him, their growls getting louder. He inched backwards trying to maintain distance, but backed into a wall. He was about to give up all hope, when suddenly he heard a deafing bark and a huge black dog landed in front of him, protecting him from the rest of the dogs.

End:(Donghao Li) The ten dogs stared at the big dog, because of the difference in size, they began to hesitate to continue attacking. The big dog continued to cover him behind him and kept looking around and growling to prevent other dogs from sneaking. After a while, the ten dogs chose to give up competing for this chassis. The alley suddenly became quiet, and the big black dog looked at the dog hiding under his shadow and said: Welcome to the world of stray dogs. He turned around and walked into the darkest part of the alley. One year later, the dog, who hid under a big black dog, has grown and become the head of the stray dogs in the city of Del Zogarde. Under his leading, every stray dog and newcomers living in peace and no more hunger.
